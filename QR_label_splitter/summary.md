# Project Summary & Next Steps: PDF Label Extractor

## 1. Current Functionality

The `extract_label.py` script is a powerful tool designed to automate the processing of PDF label sheets. Its current capabilities include:

- **Centralized Configuration**: All file paths (input PDF, coordinates, output directory) and filter settings are managed in a single `config.ini` file, making the script easy to adapt.
- **Coordinate-Based Extraction**: It reads a grid of coordinates from an Excel file (`coordinates.xlsx`) to precisely define the location of each label on a page.
- **Multi-Page Processing**: The script iterates through every page of the source PDF, applying the extraction logic to each one.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: It reads a list of `search_strings` from the `config.ini` file. It then categorizes each extracted label based on whether it contains one of these strings.
- **Dynamic File Generation**: It creates separate PDF files for each search string and one additional file (`rest.pdf`) for all labels that do not match any filter.
- **Advanced Sorting**: The labels within each output file are sorted numerically based on the number that appears after the text "LxWxH" on the label.
- **Verification**: After processing, it performs a hash-based comparison to verify that every single label from the source document has been accounted for in the final output files.

## 2. The Current Issue: Invisible Text

As you correctly identified, the current output PDFs have a subtle but significant flaw:

- **The Problem**: When searching for text (e.g., "Description") in a generated PDF, the reader finds "invisible hits" in blank areas of the page.
- **The Cause**: The current method for copying content (`show_pdf_page` with a `clip` rectangle) makes the content outside the label area *invisible*, but it does not *remove* the underlying text data from the rest of the original page. This invisible data is what the search function is finding.

## 3. The Solution: "Clean and Stamp"

To fix this, we will implement a more robust, two-step process for handling each label's content.

- **Step 1: Isolate (Clean)**: For each label, the script will create a new, temporary, in-memory PDF that is the exact size of the label. It will copy the clipped content into this clean file, which strips away all extra, invisible data.
- **Step 2: Place (Stamp)**: The script will then take this clean, isolated, single-label PDF and "stamp" it onto the final output document in the correct, sorted position.

This ensures that only the text and graphics that genuinely belong to a label are carried over, completely eliminating the invisible text problem.

## 4. Immediate Next Steps

1.  **Implement the Fix**: I will now modify the `add_content_to_page` function within `extract_label.py` to use the "Clean and Stamp" method described above.
2.  **Run and Verify**: I will then execute the updated script to regenerate the PDF files. The final output should be free of the invisible text issue.
