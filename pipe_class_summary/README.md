# pipe_class_summary

## Purpose
This folder contains reference Excel files summarizing pipe class specifications. These files are used by other scripts in the repository to validate and cross-check pipe class data in line lists and other engineering documents.

**Input:**
- Excel summary files (e.g., `pipe_class_validation_report.xlsx`, `Summary.xlsx`).

**Output:**
- Used as reference data for validation scripts; no direct output from this folder.

## Usage
- No scripts to run directly in this folder.
- Other scripts (e.g., in `line_list_check`) will read these files for validation.

## Examples
- See usage in `line_list_check_pipe_class.py` and related scripts.

## Known Limitations
- Data must be kept up to date and in the expected format.
- No automated update or validation of these files.
