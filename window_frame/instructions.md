I want to create a python script which creates a colored frame around a window I select with mouse click. The border outer contour has exact the contour of the window outer contour. The frame grows "inside" by 4 pixels. The frame acts as if it was the integral part of the selected window. It changes size with it. When it is the top window, then it is shown fully. When another window is pullod over it, then it is partly or totally covered by the top window. Again it acts as if it was the integral part of the window, which is framed. I will run this script on Windows powershell. When starting the script is shall ask for a color: 1- red, 2 - blue, 3- green, add a few more of your choice. When the selected windows is closed, then the script stops. When the powershell window is closed, the script stops. Pay attention, that minimize, maximeze shall work too.
