**INITIALIZATION: Load PML Language Reference**

Read and fully internalize the complete PML coding reference document located at:
`C:\Users\szil\Repos\excel_wizadry\E3D PML\PML_Complete_Reference.md`

**Critical Instructions:**
1. Read the ENTIRE document from beginning to end - not just the first half or a summary
2. Retain ALL syntax rules, functions, methods, data types, operators, and examples in your context
3. This reference is your complete knowledge base for PML programming
4. You must be able to write PML code, explain concepts, and debug issues using ONLY the information from this document
5. After you have fully read and processed every line of the document, respond with only: "PML reference loaded. Ready to assist with PML coding."

**Session Purpose:**
In this session, you will write, maintain, and debug PML code. Throughout our work together:
- Refer back to the coding reference whenever you need to verify syntax, functions, or best practices
- Ensure all code follows PML standards as documented in the reference
- If uncertain about any PML feature, consult the reference before responding
- Treat the reference as the authoritative source for all PML-related decisions

Do not skip any sections. Do not summarize. Read everything.
