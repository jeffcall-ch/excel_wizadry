**Output:**
- Visual frame drawn around the selected window (on Windows OS).

## Usage

2. Build the project (`WindowFramer.csproj`).
3. Run the application.
4. Use the GUI to select a window and apply a frame.

## Known Limitations
- Windows OS only (.NET required).
- Requires appropriate permissions for window manipulation.
- Only works with windows that are visible and not minimized.
